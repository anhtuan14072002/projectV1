        <h1>Western calligraphy & Latin alphabet – most influential calligraphy scripts + examples</h1>
        <p>These are some of the most influential historical periods that impacted the development of calligraphy in the
            context of the Latin alphabet (western calligraphy).</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Antiquity – Roman Empire</li>
            <li>Post Roman – Uncial & Insular period</li>
            <li>Middle ages </li>
            <li>Renaissance</li>
            <li>Baroque</li>
            <li>Modern</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I will review each of these periods and mention the most important scripts.</p>
        <h2>Antiquity – The Roman Empire</h2>
        <p>The Latin alphabet dates back to around 700 BC, and the Roman Square Capitals emerged around the first
            century AD in Rome.</p>
        <h2>Roman Capitals</h2>
        <p>Even though it’s one of many scripts from that era, it is by far the single most influential historical
            script.</p>
        <p>The beauty and the key of these letters lay in geometry and precision. One could say it reflects the finesse
            of the architecture and culture of that era.</p>
        <p>This script served as a fundamental basis for the Latin alphabet’s historical development and, essentially,
            how we communicate in writing today.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Here is a great video example by Nicoló Visioli that demonstrates how to write the Roman Capitals with a flat
            brush –</p>

        <h2>Rustic Capitals</h2>
        <p>Along with the Square Roman Capitals, we can distinguish another very influential (similar) script called the
            Rustic Capital.</p>
        <p>Emerging in the same period, they were mostly painted with flat brushes or nibs as a more common script for
            everyday use –</p>
        <p>Opposed to the Square Roman Capitals that were being used for stone engraving and more formal occasions.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Here is another example from Pinterest</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes2.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>The Post-Roman Era</h2>
        <h3>The Uncial script</h3>
        <p>Several hundred years later (second or third century AD), a new script developed influenced by the Greek
            alphabet.</p>
        <p>The Uncial script was one of the early alphabets used in Christian texts.</p>
        <p>Aside from its beauty, it was a more practical and speedily written script, ideal, for example – copying the
            Holy Bible or other manuscripts.</p>
        <p>Bold and curved strokes characterize it, and it took fewer strokes to complete a letterform compared to the
            Roman Capitals.</p>
        <p>In the Uncial script, we slowly start noticing the development of lowercase letters (aka Minuscules).</p>
        <p>I find it extremely fascinating how the alphabet developed according to their need.</p>
        <p>We can distinguish a few notable variations of the Uncial script.
        </p>
        <p>The three most notable variations of Uncial calligraphy are – </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uncial </li>
            <li>Half-Uncial</li>
            <li>Artificial Uncial</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here you can see a magnificent example of the Insular Half-Uncial from the Book Of Kells dating back from the
            9th century.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes3.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The Insular Half-Uncial is another variation of the Uncial script that originated in Ireland in the 7th
            century.</p>
        <p>The Artificial Uncial is the latest alternation of the Uncial script that emerged in the early 8th century.
        </p>
        <p>Its origins can be traced back to Southern England. The Artificial Uncial is a more elaborated version of the
            Uncial that introduces back the serif along with other more complex pen twists to achieve a more dynamic
            look from the letterforms.

        </p>
        <h2>The Early Middle Ages</h2>
        <p>As the Roman Empire spread across other European countries through the coming years, it eventually reached
            the northern parts of Europe, including England – bringing their language and the Roman alphabet.</p>
        <p>Over the following centuries, Western Europe entered the dark ages, followed by a decline of the Roman
            Empire.</p>
        <h2>The Beneventan Script
        </h2>
        <p>During this period, a new script developed that was influenced by the Uncial script, yet it developed its
            characteristics – one of them being ligatures (connecting strokes). </p>
        <p>The Beneventan script originated from the southern parts of Italy, and it was one of the longest-lasting
            Post-Roman scripts.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes4.jpeg" alt="">
        <h2>The Carolingian Minuscule</h2>
        <p>One of the most important scripts of the medieval era was the Carolingian script which was developed during
            the rule of Charlemagne in the late eighth century.</p>
        <p>Charlemagne assigned Alcuin (Monk of York) to be his librarian and teacher and to copy both religious texts
            and manuscripts as well as other texts of science and literature dating from the Greek and Roman era.</p>
        <p>Alcuin, along with his team of scribes in a scriptorium based in Tours (France), developed a more streamlined
            script that served as a basis for the lowercase alphabet that we use today.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes5.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Here is another great example of the Carolingian script by my friend Paul Antonio –</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0s-dnWeH7Qw?si=Wlvca329EAw9gfQT"

            referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h2>The Insular Script</h2>
        <p>Another important mention of this era is the Insular script.</p>
        <p>A medieval script developed in Ireland, and it was influenced by the scripts from the Roman era.</p>
        <p>This particular script was influenced by Irish Christianity, which helped spread the script across England
            and continental Europe.</p>
        <p>One of the most well-known examples of the Insular script is the Book of Kells (among many others)

        </p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes6.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="/images/calli_wes7.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>The Middle Ages – Gothic Period</h2>
        <p>Following the post-Roman era, a new script developed in Northern Europe (12th century).</p>
        <p>The Gothic scripts are VERY popular today, practiced by many calligraphers – several different scripts
            (styles) developed throughout this period.</p>
        <p>However, the changes were more noticeable this time in the new Gothic script.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes9.gif" alt="">
        <p>Characterized by more compressed, thick, straight, and angular shapes, it was the opposite compared to the
            round shapes that characterized the Carolingian script.</p>
        <p>Although the Carolingian script was beautiful, it was time-consuming and took more space per page due to its
            round shapes and counterparts.</p>
        <p>Once again, the way of writing was adapted to the current need of the people – which at the time was a higher
            demand for handwritten books.</p>
        <p>Blackletter (Gothic) scripts also include different (similar) styles that evolved in different parts of
            Europe, such as –</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Textura Quadrata</li>
            <li>Textura Presciscus</li>
            <li>Batarde</li>
            <li>Fraktur</li>
            <li>Rotunda</li>
            <li>etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes10.png" alt="">
        <p>You’ll find two step-by-step tutorials on how to get started with the Textura Quadrata script and the Fraktur
            script on my website.</p>
        <p>By now, the Gothic became the new way of writing across Europe.</p>
        <p>Books and legal documents were in high demand, and scribes were the only ones who could perform such tasks at
            that time.</p>
        <p>Scribes and book producers formed guilds, and soon enough, they had a monopoly over book production and legal
            documents – thus making them very powerful at the time.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes11.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>All Good Things Must Come To An End…</h2>
        <p>One of the most crucial events in the second millennium was the invention of the printing press.</p>
        <p>A revolutionary invention by Johannes Gutenberg that brought prosperity to the world but put an end to the
            scribe.</p>
        <p>The printing press (and movable type) broke the monopoly, and simply no scribe could compete with a machine.
        </p>
        <p>The printing press could run over a hundred pages within an hour, while the scribe could only do one.</p>
        <p>This massive upgrade allowed millions of books to be printed in a very short period.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes12.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>The Renaissance Era</h2>
        <p>As the year passed, the middle ages ended, and a new era arrived.</p>
        <p>An era of ‘’rebirth’’ for Western Europe and upcoming prosperity in major human activities, such as art,
            science, economy, etc.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes13.jpg" alt="">
        <p>At the time, the gothic script that was developed in Northern Europe was the dominant script being used.</p>
        <p>However, that particular way of writing did not really resonate with the Italians.</p>
        <p>There was one scholar in particular who considered the Gothic to be rather unpractical and who openly
            criticized it in his manuscripts.</p>
        <p>His name was Francesco Petrarca.</p>
        <p>Petrarca described it as a script that appeals to the eye from a distance but creates fatigue from up close
            and that its purpose should be for something other than reading.</p>
        <p>Francesco also argued that writing should be clear, simple, and orthographically correct.</p>
        <p>These were the notions that gave birth to the Humanist minuscule.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes14.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>The Humanist Minuscule</h2>
        <p>This is said to be one of the most significant and defining Western scripts.</p>
        <p>It was very popular in Italy at the time, and this script presented a model for the Venetian typeface.</p>
        <p>The Humanist minuscule was influenced by the Carolingian hand, as the scholars of that time period were
            particularly keen on perceiving themselves as the inheritors of the antique era.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes15.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>The Cancellaresca Script (Italic)</h2>
        <p>The Cancellaresca script was another major update in the way people write.</p>
        <p>It was particularly innovative because it improved as a script in terms of functionality and speed of
            writing.</p>
        <p>Scholar Niccolò de’ Niccoli was dissatisfied with how laborious the Humanist minuscule was, so he created a
            slanted script that required fewer strokes and that could be joined with other letters.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes16.jpg" alt="">
        <p>One of the biggest changes was made to the lowercase letter a, which was quite different from the one in the
            Humanist minuscule script.</p>
        <p>Another very important mention about the Cancellaresca script is that it served as a base for cursive writing
            that we teach and use today.</p>
        <h2>The Baroque era</h2>
        <p>After the period of Rennaisance, the Cancellaresca Corsiva provided the foundation for a new script to be
            developed. </p>
        <h6>Fun fact –
        </h6>
        <p>The word “cursive” is derived from the Medieval Latin word “cursivus,” which translates to “running.”

        <h2>The Copperplate Script
        </h2>
        <p>During the sack of Rome (1527), many scribes moved to the southern parts of France, where they developed the
            Italic Cancellaresca, which was later adapted to the French style Rhonde in the early 17th century.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t until the end of the 17th century when books with the French Rhonde script reached England, where
            John Ayres and William Banson refined their interpretations of the French script.</p>
        <p>During the following years and with the help of fellow writing masters such as Goerge Bickham, the English
            Roundhand spread across the world due to British Mercantile Trade.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes18.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The name Copperplate originates back from when writing was engraved on plates made out of copper, which
            writing masters would use for printing samples of their beautiful work.</p>
        <p>It was being done this way because printing machines and movable type could not reproduce (yet) such
            complexity and variations of styles.</p>
        <p>This fantastic article by Sybille talks more in detail about how the name Copperplate became the standard
            term for this particular calligraphy style.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes19.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>The Spencerian Script</h2>
        <p>This script originated in the United States and was developed in the 19th century by Platt Rogers Spencer.
        </p>
        <p>Platt Roger Spencer developed a style of penmanship that was used as a standard of writing for nearly a
            hundred years – up until the point the typewriting machine came along in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>What made this script so popular and influential was not only its beauty but also the functionality that lays
            behind the way you write it.</p>
        <h6>Fun fact</h6>
        <p>it is said that the Spencerian script served as an influence point for the Coca-Cola logotype, which we all
            know is one of the most iconic logotypes in the world.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes20.jpg" alt="">
        <p>In this article, Dr. Joseph Vitolo talks more in-depth about the Copperplate and Spencerian scripts (as well
            as their differences) with plenty of examples. </p>
        <h2>The Modern Era</h2>
        <p>Although it seemed that machines had turned writing by hand obsolete, calligraphy took various directions,
            such as advertisement and demand in novelty for type design.</p>
        <p>We mark the modern era from the beginning of the 20th century with pioneers such as Edward Johnston and
            Rudolf Koch – also known as the fathers of modern calligraphy. </p>
        <p>Many new developments occurred in the last 100+ years, and it would drag this article out if we were to cover
            all of it. </p>
        <p>Instead, we are going to stick to the most impactful developments. </p>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes21.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>The Foundational Hand</h2>
        <P>This hand is set to be one of the most iconic alphabets in the whole realm of calligraphy alphabets due to
            its clearly defined characters.</P>
        <P>Edward Johnston devised it in the early twentieth century.</P>
        <P>The Foundational hand is an adaptation of the Carolingian script from the post-Roman era.
        </P>
        <img src="/images/calli_wes22.jpg" alt="">
        <P>According to Edward Johnston, the Foundational hand is the best script for a beginner to start learning the
            art of calligraphy.</P>
        <P>You can find a full step-by-step tutorial on the Foundational Hand on my website.</P>
        <H2>Neuland Capitals</H2>
        <p>Calligrapher and type designer Rudolf Koch designed these capitals in the early twentieth century. </p>
        <p>It’s an iconic and vigorous alphabet that many calligraphers still practice all over the world – ideal for
            large-scale and display work.</p>
        <h2>Modern Calligraphy Styles</h2>
        <p>Modern calligraphy is often associated with bouncy and whimsical brush calligraphy, often found on Instagram
            and Pinterest.</p>
        <p>However, it’s much more than that.</p>
        <p>Modern calligraphy refers to any writing style that does not adhere to the rules of traditional scripts.</p>
        <p>That doesn’t mean scribbling something on paper can be considered modern calligraphy.</p>
        <p>There are still standards of quality and beauty that can differentiate a skilled hand from someone just
            starting.</p>
        <p>Also, modern calligraphy is not just related to a single writing tool such as the brush pen.</p>
        <p>Modern calligraphy can be done with brushes, broad-edged pens, pointed nibs, markers, and more.</p>
        <p>You can create a modern calligraphy script that has its basis in the Copperplate script or even the Fraktur
            script.</p>
        <p>You can also flip the script and create something completely different.</p>
        <p>I think that’s exactly the beauty of modern calligraphy.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, I created this beginner’s tutorial on how to start with modern calligraphy (with a brush pen).
        </p>
        <p>Along with it, you’ll find some free downloadable worksheets.</p>

        <h2>Additional Resources On The History Of Calligraphy</h2>
        <p>Before we wrap up this article, I wanted to share additional resources for history buffs.</p>
        <p>As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, writing a single article on more than 2000 years of history
            is not easy.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I simply couldn’t include all the details.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, this would have turned into a small booklet rather than an online article.</p>
        <p>If you prefer to watch, I have the perfect resource for you!</p>
        <p>A documentary from 1980 called Alphabet: The Story of Writing.</p>
        <p>In this documentary, master calligrapher Donald Jackson will take you through an exciting journey of the
            development of the Latin alphabet.</p>
        <p>I watched this documentary like five times already, and I love it.</p>
