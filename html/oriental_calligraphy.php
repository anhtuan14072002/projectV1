        <h2>Orental Calligraphy</h2>
        <p>Eastern calligraphy is an ancient and refined art form, expressed through the writing of beautiful
            characters. This art has flourished in East Asian cultures such as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Each
            country has its own styles and characteristics, but they all share fundamental principles of balance,
            harmony, and expressiveness. Here is an overview of Eastern calligraphy:

        </p>
        <h4>1. Chinese Calligraphy</h4>
        <p>Chinese calligraphy, known as "Shufa" (书法), is a significant part of Chinese culture. It includes various
            styles of writing such as Kaishu (Standard Script), Xingshu (Running Script), Caoshu (Cursive Script), and
            Zhuanshu (Seal Script). The primary tools of Chinese calligraphy are the brush, ink, inkstone, and xuan
            paper. Chinese calligraphy is not just a way of writing characters but also a form of meditation and a means
            of expressing the writer's soul.</p>
        <h4>2. Japanese Calligraphy</h4>
        <p>Japanese calligraphy, or "Shodo" (書道), is heavily influenced by Chinese calligraphy but has developed its own
            unique features. The writing style in Japan may include Kanji (Chinese characters) and Kana (syllabic
            scripts). While Kanji conveys strength and fluidity, Kana is more gentle and delicate. Japanese calligraphy
            emphasizes not only aesthetics but also the conveyance of the writer's emotions and spirit.</p>
        <h2>3. Korean Calligraphy</h2>
        <p>Korean calligraphy, known as "Seoye" (서예), also originated from Chinese calligraphy but has distinct
            characteristics. Korea has its unique Hangul alphabet, and Korean calligraphy combines Chinese characters
            and Hangul, creating a very special style. The tools and techniques of Korean calligraphy are similar to
            those of Chinese calligraphy, but the creativity and transformation in writing characters reflect the Korean
            cultural identity.

        </p>

        <h2>4. Vietnamese Calligraphy
        </h2>

        <p>Vietnamese calligraphy, or "Thư pháp Hán Nôm," uses Chinese characters and Nom characters, an ancient
            Vietnamese writing system. Vietnamese calligraphy is deeply influenced by Chinese calligraphy but has
            evolved to fit the Vietnamese language and culture. Modern Vietnamese calligraphy also uses the Latin-based
            Quoc Ngu script, adding to the richness and diversity of calligraphy art in Vietnam.

        </p>
        <h2>5. Tools and Techniques
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Brush: The primary tool in Eastern calligraphy, made from animal hair such as goat, wolf, or rabbit.
            </li>
            <li>Ink: Traditionally made from soot and glue, known as "ink stick," which is ground with water on an
                inkstone.</li>
            <li>Inkstone: Used to grind the ink stick into liquid form before writing.</li>
            <li>Xuan Paper: Special paper used for calligraphy, known for its good absorbency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>6. Significance
        </h2>
        <p>Eastern calligraphy is not only a visual art but also a means to train the mind and spirit. It requires
            patience, delicacy, and deep understanding of culture and history. Calligraphy is seen as a symbol of
            elegance and intellect and is an integral part of East Asian cultural heritage</p>
        <h2>7. Modern Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Today, Eastern calligraphy is not only preserved as cultural heritage but also applied in various modern art
            forms such as graphic design, visual arts, and fashion. Calligraphy has also become a hobby and a means of
            stress relief and meditation in modern life.

            Thus, Eastern calligraphy is a rich and diverse art form, deeply reflecting the cultures and souls of East
            Asian peoples.
        </p>
        <h2>Here I will guide you to write some types of firecracker letters</h2>
        <h4>The first is Chinese calligraphy</h4>
        <p>To write calligraphy, you need four materials</p>
        <ul>

            <li>A brush</li>
            <li>Ink</li>
            <li>Inkstone (this can be omitted if you use liquid ink)</li>
            <li>Paper
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, these are called 文房四宝 (wénfángsìbǎo), or the Four Treasures of Study.</p>
        <p>Brushes are traditionally made with white, black, or yellow animal hair (such as rabbit, goat, or weasel
            hair) bundled together and coming to a point</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_or.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The hair is pushed into a tube made of bamboo or wood, creating the handle. </p>
        <p>The brush must be flexible in order to create the flowing strokes in calligraphy</p>
        <p>The calligrapher can then use an inkstone to grind the block down to powder and mix it with water.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_or1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This way, he or she can control the viscosity of the ink. Liquid ink can also be used, but is more difficult
            to transport and can be messier.</p>
        <p>Lastly, paper was originally made from the fibers of plants such as mulberry, hemp, or bamboo.</p>
        <p>This was much more affordable than silk </p>
        <h4>Differences Between English and Chinese Calligraphy</h4>
        <p>Writing English calligraphy is very different from Chinese calligraphy.</p>
        <p>As someone who personally enjoys hand lettering, I know from experience that the style used for English
            calligraphy doesn’t carry over well into Chinese calligraphy.</p>
        <p>In English calligraphy, one of the basic elements requires down strokes to be thicker than up strokes,
            creating a contrast that is pleasing to the eye.</p>
        <p>However, these rules don’t apply for Chinese calligraphy.</p>
        <p>However, one important point that does (somewhat) carry over from English to Chinese is stroke order.</p>
        <p>Normally, writing words in English doesn’t require a certain stroke order.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_or2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Sure, maybe when you were learning to write back in elementary school, your teacher taught you to write
            letters a certain way.</p>
        <p>But in every day life, using a pencil or pen to write, it’s not noticeable whether you write the letter “V”
            with two down strokes, one up and one down, or both up!</p>
        <p>However, when writing calligraphy in English, the order does become a bit more important because the down
            strokes should be thicker and the up strokes thinner.</p>
        <p>In Chinese, stroke order is important, even in regular writing, but more so in calligraphy. In both cases, if
            your pen or pencil drags when writing quickly, these extra strokes can either be clues as to what the
            character should be, or misleading and confusing.</p>
        <p>Even when writing characters on my phone, I’ve noticed that I can write a really messy character, and my
            phone will still recognize it, as long as I’ve used the correct stroke order.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the way the brush drags across the paper changes the look of the character, so the correct
            stroke order and even direction of the stroke is essential!</p>
        <h4>Styles of Calligraphy</h4>
        <p>There are five basic styles of calligraphy.</p>
        <p>Each style is very distinct and has developed over the years.</p>
        <h4>Seal Script</h4>
        <p>The first style is Seal Style or Seal Script, also called 篆书 (zhuànshū).</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_or3.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Its name comes from the fact that this script was often engraved on stones or seals.</p>
        <p>This style was created during the Chin Dynasty.</p>
        <h4>Clerical Script</h4>
        <p>The second style is Clerical Script, or 隶书 (lìshū).</p>
        <p>This style was also using during the Chin Dynasty by government officials.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_or4.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The word itself refers to servitude because this script was used by clerks working in prisons.</p>
        <p>This style is more efficient, simplifying some of the more complex curves of the Seal Style in favor of sharp
            bends, squared instead of round.</p>
        <p>This style is also a popular style for beginners to learn, as there aren’t as many strokes to learn</p>
        <h4>Running Script</h4>
        <p>Next is Running Script, or 草书 (cǎoshū).</p>
        <p>It was developed during the Han Dynasty.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_or5.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Many great calligraphers used this style. This style is the most abstract and doesn’t require precise strokes
            like the other styles do.</p>
        <p>At the same time, it still has its own set of rules.</p>
        <h4>Walking Script</h4>
        <p>The fourth style is Walking Script, or 行书 (xíngshū).</p>
        <p>It was formed during the Han Dynasty.</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_or6.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This style is a combination of the Running Script, and the last style listed here, the Standard Script</p>
        <p>The Walking Script is smooth and connected, but not as much as the Running Style script.

            It’s also more simplified than Standard Script.</p>
        <h4>Standard Script</h4>
        <p>Last, but not least is the Standard Script/Style, or 楷书 (kǎishū)</p>
        <img src="/images/calli_or7.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This script is widespread throughout China.</p>
        <p>It is generally used in newspapers, textbooks, and government documents.

            The other scripts are not commonly seen .</p>
        <h4>Chinese Calligraphy – Simplified vs. Traditional</h4>
        <p>When writing Chinese, you can write either</p>

            referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Traditional characters, aptly named, are more complicated, and their strokes portray more of the stories and
            history behind each character.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, simplified characters are easier to remember and were developed to increase literacy
            rates.</p>
        <p>Simplified characters are used throughout mainland China, while traditional is used in areas such as Hong
            Kong and Taiwan.</p>
        <p>When formally writing characters, traditional is a better choice, because calligraphy as an art form should
            honor the history of the characters. The greater number of strokes better showcases the beauty of the art.

        <h2>Second about how to learn Vietnamese calligraphy</h2>
        <h4>Calligraphy Writing

        </h4>

            handwriting in calligraphy contains the emotions and feelings of the writer. To write calligraphy correctly
            and beautifully from the beginning requires a lot of factors. In particular, it must be mentioned that the

        <h4>Brief Introduction to Calligraphy</h4>
        <p>
            As you know, the art of calligraphy originated in China and some countries such as Japan and Korea. Vietnam
            has gone through many colonial periods of feudal China and the Han Nom period, so the art of calligraphy may
            also have a little influence on Han Nom calligraphy, now Han Nom calligraphy is still very few writers and
            most in the North.
        </p>

        <h4>How to write basic calligraphy.</h4>
        <p>Prepare calligraphy writing tools</p>
        <p>Buy calligraphy quills. Regarding calligraphy pens, you must choose a good pen, which means that the pen has
            high elasticity, is flexible as well as can pull the pen without being out of focus. To choose a good pen,
            you must have experience in choosing a pen. You can choose some medium and small pens with a price of about
            50-70k which is good in quality.</p>
        <p>You can use the best type of water because it takes less grinding. Squid is currently sold in many places,
            the price is about 20k-100kVND/box depending on the size and size. You can see the advice on buying a quill
            pen </p>
        <img src="/images/calli_ara10.jpg" alt="">
        <p>After choosing ink and pen, we can choose paper, regular exercise paper, cotton paper, white type, with 1
            rough and smooth edge, thin paper often absorbs ink. if you don't need paper, you can also use A4 paper or
            newspaper...</p>
        <p>So after having paper, pen and ink, what do we do now? We learn to write calligraphy. What calligraphy we
            write here, and how to write it, this is the important thing, the secret of how to learn calligraphy quickly
            in a short time, there are countless reasons that you want to ask me.</p>
        <p>When you are a beginner learning to write calligraphy, you must hold the pen with the correct technique,
            which is perpendicular to the surface of the paper. Ina sitting position, the fingers and wrists must be
            relaxed and relaxed, do not strain or squeeze the pen too hard. To write soft, soulful words or handwriting.
            When writing you don't need to turn your body or shoulders. Just control your fingers, wrists, and wrists
            flexibly. With one hand, you can squeeze the paper to create more force.

        </p>
        <p>In terms of writing speed, calligraphy writing at the beginning of your life is often in a hurry, throwing a
            pen and throwing the pen around but forgetting that each stroke has the art of each stroke, so you have to
            be prepared. Before writing complete strokes, you must master the basic strokes. Thus, when writing
            calligraphy, there will be no breaks, the handwriting is regular and smooth. While writing calligraphy, when
            writing without touching the surface of the paper but lifting it up, it is called penless. On the contrary,
            it is called a pen.</p>
        <h4>How to write calligraphy</h4>
        <p>When writing calligraphy, there is a style of holding a pen that is applied by many people, which is "Five
            only holding the pen". hold all 5 fingers against the pen.</p>

        <p>The way to hold is as follows: Use three fingers, the index finger, middle and thumb, to hold the pen body.
            The inside of the tip of the thumb is close to the body of the pen. The tip of the middle finger and index
            finger are also close to the body of the pen in the opposite direction (as shown). The tip of the ring
            finger rests lightly against the body of the pen. And the little finger rests lightly on the ring finger.
        </p>
        <p>Sitting and writing posture: When sitting and writing calligraphy or practicing calligraphy, always have a
            majestic posture, a straight back, shoulders kept relaxed and comfortable, and a peaceful body and mind. You
            can choose where to write so that it is quiet. Or you can sit on the mat. Depending on each person's
            preferences and habits, there are many ways for you to write calligraphy. Specifically, standing and
            writing. You still use a desk to place writing paper, but not a chair.</p>

        <img src="/images/calli_ara11.jpg" alt="">

        <p>Sitting flat is also a good way applied by many people. However, this way to write short small paper, You
            should use a low table and sit comfortably. The writer can use a small, soft pillow to sit on. This is a
            moderately visionary way of writing, not too far or too close. When writing calligraphy with a large size,
            for convenience, you should kneel down to write. In this position, the knees must be in contact with the
            ground/ground, and the left hand is straight. There are also some other writing postures. Specifically, the
            cow leans similar to the old people when writing couplets. Or the standing posture of writing on the wall if
            you have to make a work on a fixed wall... No matter what position you write calligraphy in, you have to be
            really comfortable and interested. Thus, it brings soulful handwriting and attracts viewers.</p>
