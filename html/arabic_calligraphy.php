        <h2>Arabic Calligraphy</h2>
        <p>Arabic calligraphy is an art form that uses handwriting in languages that use the Arabic alphabet or
            alphabets derived from Arabic. This includes Arabic, Persian, Ottoman, Afghan, Pakistani, and Indian
            calligraphy. Known in Arabic as "khatt Arabi" (خط عربي), it means Arabic lines and designs.</p>
        <p>The development of Islamic calligraphy is closely tied to the Quran, with chapters and verses from the Quran
            being the most common sources for Islamic calligraphy. While the Quran does not strictly prohibit the
            depiction of humans and animals in art, such paintings have traditionally been restricted in Islamic texts
            to prevent idolatry. In ancient times, artists often circumvented legal barriers by using tiny script to
            create outlines and images.</p>
        <p>Calligraphy in Islamic society is both a valued art form and consistent with religious ethics. An old Arabic
            proverb illustrates this view by emphasizing, "The purity of writing is the purity of the soul." However,
            Islamic calligraphy is not strictly limited to religious themes, subjects, or objects. Like other forms of
            Islamic art, calligraphy includes a range of works created from various texts.</p>

        <p>The prominence of calligraphy in Islamic art is not directly related to the tradition of aniconism. Instead,
            it reflects the central role of writing and texts in Islam. Notably, in one instance, the Prophet Muhammad
            is believed to have said, "The first thing God created was the pen."</p>
        <p>Islamic calligraphy developed from two main styles: Kufic and Naskh. Each style has several variations, as
            well as specific local styles. Before the invention of paper, papyrus and parchment were used for writing.
            In the 9th century, a flow of paper from China revolutionized calligraphy.

            Pens, Paper & Ink</h6>
        <p>Before you begin with calligraphy, you need to have the right pens, paper and ink. </p>
        <p>Having the right pen is most difficult because you need to change the angle of the nib once you buy it. Most
            pens come in the angle used in English calligraphy. That can be accomplished using sandpaper. Ustadh Muthana
            Suggested starting with 1800 grit sandpaper and polishing afterwards with 2000 grit or higher. </p>
        <p>You will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your pen, with a filled ink cartridge or converter
            </li>
            <li>Two sheets of sandpaper, one with a 1800 grit surface and the other with a 2000 grit surface.
            </li>
            <li>A small cup of warm water
            </li>
            <li>Tissue or paper towels
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>How to do it:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lay the 1800 grit sandpaper on a flat surface.
            </li>
            <li>Dip the pen in water and make sure there is water on the sandpaper whenever you are sanding the nib.
            </li>
            <li>hold the pen at the desired angle. Make sure you do not hold it in the opposite angle!
            </li>
            <li>Keep hold of that angle and slowly sand away till the width of the nib is at the desired angle.
            </li>
            <li>Now you can polish the pen on the 2000 grit paper and pull it in different directions, so that it writes
                smoothly.
            </li>
            <li>Test the pen on a piece of paper to make sure it writes smoothly, and keep polishing till it does.
            </li>
            <li>Now you can start writing calligraphy.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now you can start writing calligraphy.

        <p>Pens</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sheaffer Calligraphy Pen Set (featured in the videos above, and of the highest quality)
            </li>
            <li>Pilot Parallel Pen Set (This is the one used by the teacher to explain the letters)
            </li>
            <li>Manuscipt Calligraphy Pen Set</li>
            <li>Other similar fountain pens with broad nibs sold at art or stationary stores would do.
            </li>
            <li>You should use the largest nib width at the beginning, as it is much easier to work with.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paper</p>
        <p>The paper you need is a glossy paper, but not the one used for photos, which absorbs ink. The ink should stay
            the surface of the paper, and should smudge if rubbed immediately after writing.

        </p>
        <p>Ink</p>
        <p>Waterman Ink</p>
        <p>Pelikan 4001 Fountain pen Ink</p>
        <p>Don't hesitate to choose your favorite color.
        </p>
        <p>Any other fountain pen inks would work, and make sure they are fountain pen inks, and not dip pen inks and
            especially not waterproof inks as those may clog up or even destroy your pen.
        </p>
        <p>These inks can be used with a converter or to refill empty ink cartridges using a syringe. Check out the
            playlist linked below for details.
