                <h3>Tools needed to practice the basic calligraphy strokes.</h3>
                <p>To practice the basic calligraphy strokes, you’ll need a very <b>basic calligraphy tool setup</b> (links to Amazon) – </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pen (writing tools)</b></li>
                    <li><b>Paper</b></li>
                    <p><b>Ruler</b></p>
                    <li><b>Pencil</b></li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy1.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>Pens</h4>
                <p>You can practice the basic calligraphy strokes using a brush pen, pointed nib, or even a regular pencil. </p>
                <p>If you’re just getting started, I recommend (links to Amazon) – </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Small brush pen – <b>Tombow Fudenosuke</b> or <b>Pentel Touch Brush Pen</b></li>
                    <li><b>2B Pencil</b></li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>You might also be interested in reading my review on <b>the best brush pens for calligraphy beginners.</b></p>

                <h4>Paper</h4>
                <p>Aside from your writing tool, you’ll need some paper. </p>
                <p>If you use a brush pen or a dip pen + pointed nib, you will need specific papers; otherwise, you risk ruining the tips of your brush pens or ink bleeds. </p>
                <p>I recommend the following papers (links to Amazon) – </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>HP Premium 32</b> (cheapest and ok quality)</li>
                    <li><b>Canson marker paper</b></li>
                    <li><b>Rhodia paper</b></li>
                    <li>Any other bleed-proof marker paper. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I also wrote a separate guide on <b>the best calligraphy papers.</b></p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy3.jpg" alt="">

                <h4>Ruler </h4>
                <p>You’ll need the ruler to create calligraphy guidelines to keep your basic strokes accurate and consistent.  </p>
                <p>I have a whole separate <b>tutorial on how to create calligraphy guidelines that you can read here.</b></p>
                <p>I highly recommend that you do. </p>
                <p>For guidelines, I always use and recommend the <b>rolling ruler.</b> </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy4.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>Pencil </h4>
                <p>We need the pencil to create our guidelines.</p>
                <p>I work with an HB mechanical pencil, but you can use whatever you have at hand.</p>

                <h3>What are basic strokes in calligraphy?</h3>
                <p>The basic calligraphy strokes are the building blocks of calligraphy letters. These are individual strokes that, when put together, form different letters of the lowercase alphabet. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy5.jpg" alt="">
                <p>We use basic strokes in both modern and traditional calligraphy.</p>
                <p>In fact, I talk about the basic calligraphy strokes in my modern calligraphy tutorial for beginners.</p>
                <p>Any style created with a pointed nib or a brush pen.     </p>
                <p>Let me give you a bit of context as to why these basic strokes are so important. </p>
                <p>To the untrained eye, a word in calligraphy may seem that has been created in one take without lifting the pen.</p>
                <p>Similar to cursive writing. </p>
                <p>However, calligraphy and cursive writing are two very different things. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Calligraphy is done slowly, the pen is lifted often, and each stroke is created with focus and precision. The strokes also vary in thickness.</li>
                    <li>Cursive writing, on the other hand, is more fluid, done quickly, and the pen is lifted less frequently. </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy6.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It’s essential to understand this difference because the basic calligraphy strokes allow you to drastically improve the precision and consistency of your calligraphy. </p>
                <p>The basic calligraphy strokes also help us learn how to write the whole alphabet and to identify when we should lift the pen after each stroke. </p>
                <p>In this way, you dont have to memorize the letters individually and guess when to lift the pen. </p>
                <h4>How many basic strokes does calligraphy have?</h4>
                <p>There are 8 basic calligraphy strokes, and they are – </p>
                <p>1. The entry stroke</p>
                <p>2. The underturn</p>
                <p>3. The overturn</p>
                <p>4. The compound curve</p>
                <p>5. The oval </p>
                <p>6. The reverse oval</p>
                <p>7. The ascending loop</p>
                <p>8. The descending loop</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy7.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Some letters of the alphabet are an exception to these basic strokes.</p>
                <p>I’ll get to them later in the article. </p>
                <p>Here are a few quick examples of how we use these basic strokes to combine different letters. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The letter <b>a</b> is created with an entry stroke, an oval, and an underturn.</li>
                    <li>The letter <b>n</b> is made with an underturn and a compound curve. </li>
                    <li>The letter <b>b</b> combines an entry stroke, an ascending loop, and a reverse oval. </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy8.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Now let’s take a closer look at the basic calligraphy strokes. </p>

                <h3>Basic calligraphy strokes breakdown</h3>
                <p>If you’re entirely new to calligraphy, it’s essential to understand the two basic motions. </p>
                <p>When you move upwards with your pen, your strokes should be thin (low pressure)</p>
                <p>And when you move downwards, your strokes should be thick (more pressure).</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy9.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Ok, now I’m going to go over each stroke to give you a better overview of how to write them out. </p>
                <p>Once again, it is absolutely crucial to do this using calligraphy guidelines.</p>

                <h4>1. The Entry Stroke </h4>
                <p>The entry stroke is a thin upstroke that starts from the baseline and slightly curves following the slant lines to the waistline.</p>
                <p>In most instances, you won’t have to take it up to the waistline but rather to the middle or slightly above. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy10.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Here are a few examples of what you should try to avoid –</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy11.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>2. The Underturn</h4>
                <p>Begins at the top of the waistline as a thick stroke.</p>
                <p>Then, it curves on the baseline and comes back up as a thin upstroke to the waistline.</p>
                <p>Two important things to mention here. </p>
                <p>1. The downstroke and upstroke are parallel to each other and follow the slant lines of our guidelines. </p>
                <p>2. You begin to release the pressure slightly above the baseline to get a smooth, gradual transition. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy12.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Here you can see a few examples of what you should try to avoid doing –</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy13.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>3. The Overturn </h4>
                <p>It is absolutely the same as the underturn, just in reverse.</p>
                <p>You begin from the baseline with a thin upstroke, curve on the waistline, and come back down with a thicker downstroke to the baseline.</p>
                <p>Again, both strokes are parallel and follow the slant lines.</p>
                <p>Start applying the pressure gradually right after the curve. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy14.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Here are a few examples of what you should try to avoid –    </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy15.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>4. The Compound Curve</h4>
                <p>A combination of the two previous strokes.</p>
                <p>Slightly more challenging.</p>
                <p>Begin with a thin upstroke, curve at the waistline, come down with a thicker downstroke, curve on the baseline, and back up with a thin upstroke.</p>
                <p>All three lines are parallel, following the slant lines. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy16.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Try to avoid these mistakes –</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy17.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>5. The Oval</h4>
                <p>Probably the trickiest basic calligraphy strokes.</p>
                <p>Start slightly from the right side (2-3 o’clock) with a thin upstroke. Curve upwards (counterclockwise) into a thick downstroke which is also curved. Gradually transition on the baseline into a thin upstroke to join the oval.</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy18.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Avoid these common mistakes with the oval shape-</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy19.jpg" alt="">
                <p><b>Important note –</b></p>
                <p>Another important mention about the slant of the oval stroke.</p>
                <p>I often see people confused about how to angle the oval correctly.</p>
                <p>The best way to direct the oval is by using an axis line.</p>
                <p>The axis line is basically a line that goes through the middle of an oval and splits it into two equal parts. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy20.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Obviously, you can’t always stop mid-practice just to draw an axis line for your oval.</p>
                <p>However, what you can do is imagine one and use that as a guide for the slant of your oval. </p>
                <h4>6. The Reverse Oval</h4>
                <p>Pretty much the same thing as the oval, just in reverse.</p>
                <p>Here you can also slightly modify it, and instead of joining the two strokes, the reverse oval can and in a half loop inside like this. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy21.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>7. The Ascending Loop </h4>
                <p>The ascending loop begins at the waistline and extends in a curved thin upstroke to the ascending line.</p>
                <p>At the ascending line, it curves back down towards the baseline following the slant angle.</p>
                <p>As it curves, you gradually apply pressure to create a thick downstroke. </p>
                <p>Alternatively, you could start slightly above the waistline with light pressure that gradually becomes a thicker stroke all the way to the baseline and add the loop as a second stroke.</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy22.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This second method is often used for adding flourishes at the end.</p>
                <p>Because with a closed-loop, your flourishing options are limited.</p>
                <p>Both ways are good for closed loops, so use the one that suits you best. </p>
                <p>Here are a few examples of common mistakes you should try to avoid –</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy23.jpg" alt="">

                <h4>8. The Descending Loop</h4>
                <p>Pretty much the opposite of the ascending loop.</p>
                <p>Start from the waistline with a thick stroke.</p>
                <p>Then, take it down to the descending line, and right before it, start releasing the pressure for a smooth thick, and thin transition.</p>
                <p>Then, you curve it on the descending line and right back up in a curved, thin upstroke to the baseline. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy24.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Here are a few examples of what you should try to avoid –</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy25.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>A note about counter spaces (important!)</h4>
                <p>If you don’t know what counters are, it’s basically the white space inside of the letters. </p>
                <p>We differ two types of counters – opened and closed. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy26.jpg" alt="">
                <p>To make your basic calligraphy strokes and your calligraphy, in general, more consistent, it’s important to keep an eye on your counter spaces.</p>
                <p><b>By maintaining an equal counter space (both open and closed), we get a much more consistent and balanced look. </b></p>
                <p>The example below shows that counters with equal space look much better than those without. </p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy27.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Obviously, it’s impossible to measure this perfectly, but it’s just something I wanted to point out. </p>

                <h3>Basic calligraphy strokes alphabet demonstration</h3>
                <p>In the video below, I demonstrate how I use the basic calligraphy strokes to write out the whole lowercase (minuscules) alphabet.</p>
                <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gygN6kXp3Fk" title="Colorful Brush Lettering Alphabet Using The Basic Calligraphy Strokes" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>I also created a tutorial on <b> how to write a brush calligraphy alphabet from a to z.</b></p>
                <h4>Exception letters</h4>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, some letters are an exception to these basic strokes.</p>
                <p>Their shape is simply different and unique, and therefore you memorize them. </p>
                <p>Some of these letters are – s, f, x,</p>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy28.jpg" alt="">
                <p>However, some letters have a certain element of these basic strokes, with a slight variation or addition. </p>
                <p>Here are a few examples –</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The letter t is an extended underturn (variation) with a horizontal/wavy crossbar (addition).</li>
                    <li>The letter k is an ascending loop with a small R shape below. </li>
                    <li>The letters c, e, and o are variated ovals with a small addition. </li>
                    <li>The letter q is composed of an oval and a reversed descending loop. </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images\BasicCalligraphy29.jpg" alt="">

                <h3>Basic calligraphy strokes worksheets</h3>
                <p>I’ve created free printable worksheets to help you put the theory into practice. </p>
                <p>I highly recommend you practice these basic strokes before attempting to write letters, words, sentences, etc.</p>
                <p>I promise that if you practice for just 15 minutes a day for 30 days (consistently), you will significantly improve your skills.</p>
                <p>In these worksheets, you’ll find – </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The two fundamental strokes (up thin, down thick)</li>
                    <li>The 8 basic calligraphy strokes</li>
