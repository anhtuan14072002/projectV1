                <p>These calligraphy books are part of my collection that I have been gathering for the past couple of years.</p>
                <p>The art of calligraphy encompasses a wide variety of styles and techniques, and this list contains books to satisfy any calligraphy style you’re set to study and practice.</p>
                <p>Here is a quick overview of this article – </p>
                <p>1. <b>10 Best calligraphy books</b></p>
                <p>2. <b>Bonus books (hint – free calligraphy PDF online books!)</b></p>
                <p>3. <b>Final words</b></p>
                <p>So let’s get started!</p>
                <p><b>Note -</b> If you’re just getting started with calligraphy, I highly recommend you check out my ultimate guide for calligraphy beginners.</p>

                <h3>1. The Calligrapher’s Bible by David Haris</h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Number one on my list is a very popular book loved by many calligraphers worldwide.</p>
                <p>The Calligraphers Bible is a collection of 100 complete alphabets and a basic introduction for calligraphy beginners.</p>
                <p>David Haris really didn’t hold back and included such a fantastic variety of calligraphy styles for you to study and practice.</p>
                <p>You’ll find traditional calligraphy styles such as Roman Capitals, Uncials, Carolingian, Textualis Quadrata <b>(blackletter)</b>, <b>Fraktur</b>, Chancery <b>(Italic)</b>, all the way to various modern calligraphy scripts.</p>
                <p>I really like the Calligraphers Bible because the scripts are laid out and categorized based on major historical eras such as – Roman, Insular, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Modern.</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Each alphabet is laid out on two pages.</p>
                <p>On one side, you’ll find the entire alphabet of a specific script (hand) along with a ductus.</p>
                <p>On the other side, there are practical tips and various points of interest that will help you with your <b>calligraphy practice</b>.</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The Calligraphers Bible, although it is a fantastic book, it doesn’t really cover these calligraphy scripts in much detail.</p>
                <p>Therefore I consider it more of a reference book than a book that will provide you with in-depth knowledge about calligraphy scripts.</p>
                <p>If it did, it would probably be a giant book!</p>
                <p>This is a small practical (and portable) book that you can use as a point of reference when practicing a calligraphy script.</p>
                <p>The spiral-bound is also a significant detail worth mentioning.</p>

                <h3>2. Foundations Of Calligraphy by Sheila Waters</h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks5.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Next up, we have a true calligraphy book gem.</p>
                <p>I love all the books on this list, but Foundations Of Calligraphy is a very special book for me personally.</p>
                <p>It’s the one book that really opened my eyes to the nuances of the art of calligraphy.</p>
                <p>Sheila Waters was an exceptional calligrapher, and she has compiled decades of studying and experience into this beautiful book.</p>
                <p>Filled with both instructional and inspirational material, this book will take you through a learning experience that no other book can (at least in my opinion).</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks6.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Foundations Of Calligraphy is mainly focused on traditional broad-edged calligraphy scripts.</p>
                <p>The whole book is structured to guide you from the most basic Roman Capital letter constructions to minuscules (foundational hand) and all the other scripts that have subsequently evolved throughout history.</p>
                <p>Btw. If you’re interested in learning more about calligraphy styles, be sure to check out my article on the <b>10 calligraphy styles.</b></p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks7.jpg" alt="">
                <p>For example, it covers major scripts of different eras and not so many specific variations as the Calligraphy Bible does.</p>
                <p>The book contains instructions on setting up your writing environment, writing, sitting, holding the pen, and more.</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks8.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It also teaches you how to effectively practice and prepare for professional calligraphy projects, layouts, composition, and design concepts such as balance, rhythm, symmetry, etc.</p>
                <p>I mean, the list goes on and on.</p>
                <p>What makes this book so special is the myriad of nuanced tips that Sheila sprinkled all over the book.</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks9.jpg" alt="">
                <p>These are those deeply craved “aha” moments that only someone who spent their life studying the craft can know.</p>
                <p>I HIGHLY recommend this book for ANYONE interested in learning and getting a deeper understanding of the art of calligraphy.</p>

                <h3>3. Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy by Eleanor Winters</h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks10.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If you prefer more pointed nib calligraphy and the copperplate style, this book is an excellent choice. </p>
                <p>Eleanor Winters made a complete breakdown of the copperplate script in this book. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks11.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Here are just a few of the things you will learn from Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy – </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Historical overview</li>
                    <li>Terminology and setting up guidelines</li>
                    <li>A complete breakdown of capitals, minuscules, numbers, and punctuation</li>
                    <li>Layouts and compositions</li>
                    <li>Working on commercial projects</li>
                    <li>And much more. </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks12.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy is well suited for both beginners and more experienced calligraphers. </p>
                <p>I’ve also found ideas and principles that were helpful for my hand lettering skills (drawing letters).</p>
                <p>I particularly liked this book’s extremely detailed section about how to write both minuscules and capitals. </p>
                <p>There aren’t just examples of how to write the letters but also examples of poorly executed letterforms that you can use as a very useful reference point. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks13.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It also goes super deep into letter connections and letter-spacing (among other things), leaving almost nothing to doubt. </p>
                <p>If you want to get started right away, you can check out this copperplate calligraphy tutorial for beginners.</p>

                <h4>Quick Bonus book – Copperplate Script: A Yin and Yang Approach</h4>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks14.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If we’re talking about copperplate calligraphy books, I must mention Paul Antonio’s book. I haven’t personally read the Yin and Yang Approach, but I have heard sooo many good things about it. Paul is also a friend of mine, and I know that this book is jam-packed with knowledge and experience accumulated over decades of intensive studying, practice, and love for the art of calligraphy. </p>

                <h3>4. The Art Of Calligraphy – A practical guide to the skills and techniques by David Harris </h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks15.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If someone asked me what the best book to start learning traditional calligraphy scripts is, I would recommend The Art Of Calligraphy By David Harris. </p>
                <p>And yes, it’s the same David Harris that created the Calligraphers Bible that I mentioned earlier. </p>
                <p>This book is so well made from the content structure, historical overview, and clear presentation of the many alphabets to just the general design of each page. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks16.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The Art of Calligraphy gives you everything you need to start learning and practicing a variety of calligraphy styles. </p>
                <p>I really like this book because it teaches you some of the most popular calligraphy scripts in the history of the Latin alphabet. </p>
                <p>And it does that chronologically as they developed throughout more than 2000 years of history. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks17.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Additionally, I love how each script (style) gets such a detailed presentation laid out on both pages of the book. </p>
                <p>You really get a clear view of the ductus of each letter that is even built up in different colors. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks18.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Perhaps the book’s only drawback is that it doesn’t have a spiral-bound. </p>
                <p>However, that’s just my personal preference</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, this is a fantastic instructional book that will help you get started with the art of calligraphy.</p>

                <h3>5. Modern Calligraphy by Molly Suber Thorpe</h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks19.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Are you interested in learning modern calligraphy with a pointed nib?</p>
                <p>Well, if so, look no further! </p>
                <p>Because Molly’s book has you covered. </p>
                <p>This book is very nicely designed, and it’s packed with a ton of great information. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks20.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It will teach you all the basics needed to create fun and whimsical letterforms in no time. </p>
                <p>Molly will guide you through the basic supplies, practice strokes, and a wide variety of styles for both capital and minuscule letters. </p>
                <p>You’ll also learn about layouts, spacing, compositions, advanced tools, and a section dedicated to left-handed calligraphers. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks21.jpg" alt="">
                <p>But wait, that’s not all. </p>
                <p>The cherry on top is that the second half of the book is a collection of D.I.Y. project ideas. </p>
                <p>Projects such as custom envelopes, postcards, stamps, and more. </p>
                <p>Molly made sure to give you enough ideas to put all the practice into work</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks22.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Be sure to check my tutorial on how to get started with modern calligraphy using a brush pen.</p>
                <p>There is also a similar tutorial, but this one focuses on how to do modern calligraphy with a dip pen.</p>

                <h3>6. Calligraphy – A complete guide by Julien Chazal</h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks23.jpg" alt="">
                <p>I would describe this book as an advanced version of the Art Of Calligraphy by David Harris. </p>
                <p>It offers an in-depth look at various calligraphy styles – from traditional to modern scripts. </p>
                <p>Each script has been clearly laid out on the page with a comprehensive ductus (little arrows indicating the direction of strokes).</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks24.jpg" alt="">
                <p>I really like that each letter of every alphabet in this book contains a little note underneath, giving you extra insight into how to correctly write it. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks25.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Julien also covers the basics of calligraphy. </p>
                <p>From tools, terminology, basic strokes, letter structures, and more. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks26.jpg" alt="">
                <p>To wrap up this remarkable book, there is a whole section on decorations and layouts that will further enhance your calligraphy skills. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks27.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If you’re just getting started with calligraphy, I would instead recommend the Art Of Calligraphy by David Harris. </p>
                <p>However, if you’ve been practicing calligraphy for a while now, you’ll benefit from all the extra in-depth knowledge Julien shares in this fantastic book. </p>

                <h3>7. The Speedball Textbook (multiple editions) by a variety of artists</h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks28.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The Speedball Textbook series has recently celebrated its 105th anniversary. </p>
                <p>Yup! 105 years! </p>
                <p>The Speedball Textbook was initially created by Ross F. George as an instructional manual. </p>
                <p>Last year the latest (25th) edition was released, and it has become so much more than that. </p>
                <p>First of all, let me say that the 25th edition is just out of this world. </p>
                <p>Not just because it contains a ton of great reference alphabets and jaw draping calligraphy artwork for inspiration. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks29.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks30.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks31.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Seeing dozens of skillful calligraphers from all over the world coming together and creating this absolutely fantastic booklet is fantastic. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks32.jpg" alt="">
                <p>I currently have the 23rd and the 25th edition. </p>
                <p>I would love to eventually increase my collection and have all of them. </p>
                <p>If you are interested in getting a Speedball Textbook, I would definitely recommend going with the 25th edition. </p>
                <p>It is filled, and I mean jam-packed, with many different styles and reference alphabets for you to practice from. </p>
                <p>You won’t just find calligraphy inspiration. There is also content on hand lettering, sign painting, improving handwriting, and more.</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks33.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks34.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks35.jpg" alt="">
                <p>From traditional scripts to modern interpretations, I really believe that the 25th edition of the Speedball Textbook offers something for everyone. </p>
                
                <h3>8. Medieval Calligraphy – Its History and Technique by Marc Drogin</h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks36.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If you like to read about calligraphy history (as much as I do), you’ll love this book. </p>
                <p>When I started researching the history of the Latin alphabet and its development throughout the years, I’ve come across many contradictions and a general lack of information. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there is a ton of information online, and there is a variety of interpretations when it comes to exact dates and correct nomenclature. </p>
                <p>Marc’s book is a fantastic read with many references, and you can really tell that it has been very well researched. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks37.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks38.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The book is divided into two main sections. </p>
                <p>The first is the detailed historical overview, and the second is more of a “how-to” packed with historical references.</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks39.jpg" alt="">
                <p>I really love the first part of the book, where Marc describes the development of the Latin alphabet in great detail. </p>
                <p>All the way from its early development and the Roman Capitals to the peak of the gothic scripts.</p>
                <p>Each page is filled with detailed text and many reference images from various manuscripts. </p>
                <p>I particularly enjoyed reading about the way scribes used to live in that day and age and the funny story about Titivillus A.K.A. The Patron Demon Of Calligraphy 😀</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks40.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks41.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The only thing I wish was presented in more detail was the instructional part of the book. </p>
                <p>Don’t get me wrong, it contains great info and insights. I just wish it was presented better and more comprehensively, like, i.e., The Art Of Calligraphy. </p>

                <h3>9. Writing & Illuminating & Lettering by Edward Johnston </h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks42.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Would you believe it if I told you that this book was originally published in 1906?</p>
                <p>This book and its contents have been around for over 100 years. </p>
                <p>In case you haven’t heard of Edward Johnston, he is considered to be (among others) the father of modern calligraphy. </p>
                <p>He is famous for his design of the Johnston’s typeface and the London Underground system and his vast influence on a generation of calligraphers and type designers. </p>
                <p>His book, Writing & Illuminating & Lettering, is a must-have for any calligrapher/lettering artist. </p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks43.jpg" alt="">
                <p>In Johnston’s book, you will find a ton of crucial information that will give you a much deeper knowledge about calligraphy. </p>
                <p>The book is divided into two parts.</p>
                <p>The first part focuses on writing and illuminating.</p>
                <p>Things such as setting up your writing environment, choosing the correct tools, how to hold the pen, spacing, creating (and planning) manuscripts, versals, gilding, and more.</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks44.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The second part is oriented toward more theoretical teaching of lettering and calligraphy.</p>
                <p>The qualities of good lettering, constructions, arrangement, proportions, layouts, compositions, and more.</p>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks45.jpg" alt="">
                <p>I really enjoy the rich content of the book’s second part, and I often come back to it.</p>
                <p>The way I read this book was like any other book. In the morning, with a cup of coffee, while traveling somewhere, etc.  </p>
                <p>It is not like other books on this list, one which you would use as an exemplar for you to copy from. </p>
                <p>It’s a smaller-sized book which makes it convenient for traveling and similar situations. </p>

                <h3>10. The Bible of Illuminated Letters by Margaret Morgan</h3>
                <img src="images\10BestCalligraphyBooks46.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This book stands out from this list since it has a specific focus on the world of calligraphy. </p>
