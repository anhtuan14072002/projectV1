                <p>If you want to learn how to start with calligraphy, you’ve come to the right place.
                On this page, you will find everything you need to know about what calligraphy is and how to get started with it.
                </p>
                <p>Let’s get started!</p>
                <h4>What is calligraphy? In simple words.</h4>
                <p>Calligraphy is a visual art form that creates decorative handwriting using specific tools.</p>
                <p>In other words, calligraphy is the art of beautiful writing.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101.png" alt="">
                <p>However, calligraphy is a broad term that encompasses a wide variety of styles and cultures from every corner of the globe. 
                </p>
                <p>We can primarily divide calligraphy into different cultures around the world.</p>
                <p>To name a few – </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Western calligraphy (the Latin alphabet)</li>
                    <li>Chinese calligraphy</li>
                    <li>Japanese calligraphy</li>
                    <li>Arabic calligraphy</li>
                    <li>Indian calligraphy</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_1.png" alt="">
                <p><i><b>Note:</b> Despite the art of beautiful writing being present in many cultures across the globe, I focus primarily on studying, practicing, and teaching Western calligraphy and the Latin alphabet. </i></p>
                <br>
                <h4>What are some key features of calligraphy?</h4>
                <p>It’s important to distinguish between handwriting (including cursive) and calligraphy.</p>
                
                <p>It is common for the untrained eye to see these two as the same.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, here are a few key features of calligraphy. </p>
                <h4>1. Variation in stroke thickness.</h4>
                <p>Calligraphy can be done with any writing tool; however, there are specific tools dedicated to calligraphy.</p>
                <p>The two most common tools are broad-edged and pointed pens.</p>
                <p>These tools are specific for calligraphy because they can create stroke thickness variations.</p>
                <p>The broad-edged nib achieves that by keeping the pen at a consistent angle (and the direction of movement), whereas the pointed nib achieves that by adding/removing pressure as you write.</p>
                <p>The contrast in stroke thickness that these tools can create while you write is one of the most prominent features of calligraphic letters. </p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_2.png" alt="">
                <h4>2. Letterform proportions and structure.</h4>
                <p>A specific proportion and structure of letters are maintained throughout the writing.</p>
                <p>This is particularly important for traditional calligraphy scripts.</p>
                <p>For example, Blackletter calligraphy is created with a broad-edged tool.</p>
                <p>The angle of the pen is held at a 45-degree angle.</p>
                <p>The letters are completely vertical, and they are proportionally sized according to the width of the pen.</p>
                <p>That’s why we use the pen width as a measuring unit when it comes to broad-edged (flat tip) calligraphy styles.</p>
                <p>These are just some of the “rules” you need to follow to create this particular style of calligraphy.</p>
                <p><b>Calligraphy guidelines</b> allow us to focus on creating beautiful and consistent letterforms.</p>
                <p>Without calligraphy guidelines, you would have to guess and eyeball all the sizing and proportions, and it would make the whole process much more difficult.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_4.png" alt="">
                <h4>3. Consistency and uniformity.</h4>
                <p>Calligraphy places great emphasis on consistent and uniform letterforms.</p>
                <p>Achieving consistent stroke widths, angles, spacing, rhythm, etc., and overall letter shapes throughout a piece of writing is essential for creating a cohesive and visually pleasing result.</p>
                <p>In the example below, I am using two different colored brush pens along with the <b>basic calligraphy strokes</b> to write out the word minimum.</p>
                <p>I am focused on maintaining consistent spacing, slant, space within the letters (also known as counters), etc.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_5.jpg" alt="">
                <p><i>The word “minimum” is a popular practice word for calligraphers since it contains many similar shapes.</i></p>
                <h4>What is calligraphy used for?</h4>
                <p>Today, calligraphy is used in many different ways.</p>
                <p>From personal use as a relaxing hobby and artistic expression to commercial purposes, official documents, wedding invitations, font designs, and much more. </p>
                <p><b>The written word can be used to convey not only information but also emotions.</b></p>
                <p>As you can see in the image below, the same sentence written in two different styles can communicate a very different feeling.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_6.png" alt="">
                <p>Often we don’t pay any attention to letters used in advertisements, logotypes, and other promotional materials.</p>
                <p>Try to pay more attention the next time you’re in the city or any other place where you can see letters around you.</p>
                <p>Take a moment to look at the letters and think about what they communicate on an emotional level and how they make you feel.</p>
                <p>This could also be a helpful exercise to determine what sort of style of calligraphy you want to learn and practice.</p>
                <p>At this point, it’s also important to mention that calligraphy and hand lettering are not the same thing.</p>
                <p>Despite the fact that these two terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
                <p>When doing calligraphy, you’re <b>writing</b> letters, whereas, with hand lettering, you <b>draw</b> them.</p>
                <p>I wrote an article about <b> difference between hand lettering and calligraphy.</b> Check it out!</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_7.jpg" alt="">
                <h4>The Origins Of Calligraphy</h4>
                <p>Paleographers and historians believe the first alphabet evolved in Phoenicia around 1200 B.C.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_8.png" alt="">
                <p>As Phoenicians merchants traveled and traded across the Mediterranean, the Greeks adopted their alphabet around the eighth century B.C.</p>
                <p>Soon after, the Etruscans adopted (and adapted) the Phoenician alphabet, which the Romans subsequently took.</p>
                <p>By the first century B.C., the Romans had already developed several scripts using the Latin alphabet, which we all know and use today.</p>
                <p>The word calligraphy derives from the Greek words “kallos” (beauty) and “graphein” (to write).</p>
                <p>According to Britannica.com, the word calligraphy entered most European languages by the end of the 16th century.</p>
                <p>This was initiated by the introduction of the printing press in the mid-15th century and thus created a clear distinction between handwriting and more elaborate forms of lettering.</p>
                <p>We often take it for granted, but the written word is one of the foundations of human civilization.</p>
                <p>Writing has allowed us to share and preserve information, ideas, and knowledge for thousands of years.</p>
                <p>The history of calligraphy is rich, with many evolutions throughout centuries.</p>
                <p>Below you can see a shorter general overview of how the Latin alphabet evolved throughout history.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_9.png" alt="">
                <p>In case you want to learn more about the history of calligraphy, I’ve written a separate in-depth article on the history of calligraphy and how it evolved throughout the years. </p>
                <h4>How To Get Started With Calligraphy? The Three-Step Formula</h4>
                <p>Ok, now we know what calligraphy is, what it is used for, and where it comes from.</p>
                <p>Now it’s time to learn how to start learning and practicing calligraphy.</p>
                <p>If you’re a complete beginner, the best way to start learning calligraphy is by following the three-step formula :</p>
                <p><b>1. Choose a calligraphy style that you want to study and practice.</b></p>
                <p><b>2. Pick the correct calligraphy pen for the style you want to practice + the essential calligraphy tools.</b></p>
                <p><b>3. Find a proper study resource and create an effective practice routine.</b></p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_10.png" alt="">
                <p>With that in mind, let’s have a closer look at each of these three key steps. </p>
                <h4>Step 1 – Choosing A Calligraphy Style </h4>
                <p>The first thing you should do is find the calligraphy style that appeals the most to you.</p>
                <p>This is the first step since the next step (picking the tools) will depend on your calligraphy style, aka script choice.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_11.jpg" alt="">
                <p>I often get asked what is the easiest calligraphy style to start with, and the truth is that each style has its little nuances that will create challenges along the way.</p>
                <p>Some people might find working with a pointed nib easier, while others find it more comfortable with a broad-edged pen.</p>
                <p>To learn, understand, and properly execute a specific calligraphy style, you need to stick to it for an extended period, so it’s essential that you choose something that is appealing to you. </p>
                <p>Generally speaking, there are a few main categories of calligraphy styles.</p>
                <p>We can categorize calligraphy styles according to the type of pen we use. The main categories are – </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pointed nib calligraphy styles (Copperplate, Spencerian, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Broad-edged calligraphy styles (Uncial, Gothic, Foundational, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Brush pen calligraphy </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_12.png" alt="">
                <p>To make it easier for you, I created a separate guide on the 10 best calligraphy styles for beginners.</p>
                <p>That article contains the most popular calligraphy styles and many helpful resources to help you make the right first step</p>
                <p>So if you’re a complete beginner, make sure to check out that article first.</p>
                <p><i><b>Quick note:</b> The different calligraphy styles are usually referred to as scripts. People commonly use the term “calligraphy fonts,” but that is incorrect. Fonts are what (today) computers use to display text.</i></p>
                <h4>Step 2 – Picking The Correct Calligraphy Pen + The Essential Calligraphy Tools</h4>
                <p>Remember, not every calligraphy pen suits every style.</p>
                <p>This is why it’s crucial to pick the style and then the calligraphy pen that fits that style.</p>
                <p>Entry-level pens and tools are not crazy expensive, but it would be silly to waste your money simply because you didn’t know what you needed to get started.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_13.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Luckily, with one pen, you can create a bunch of different styles.</p>
                <p>On top of that, there are only three main pen categories to choose from.</p>
                <p>To help you find the right pick, I have created a complete in-depth guide on choosing the right calligraphy pen. s</p>
                <p>In addition to the calligraphy pen, you will also need the basic calligraphy tools.</p>
                <p>The basic calligraphy tools are :</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The calligraphy pen</li>
                        <li>Paper</li>
                        <li>Ruler</li>
                        <li>Pencil</li>
                        <li>Eraser</li>
                        <li>Calligraphy ink</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_14.jpg" alt="">
                <p>To learn more about this, I created a separate article on the 6 essential calligraphy tools. </p>
                <p>By following these two guides, you will find the correct high-quality tools without wasting your time or breaking the bank. </p>
                <h4>What If You Cannot Afford Or Find Any Calligraphy Tools In Your Area?</h4>
                <p>Fear not!</p>
                <p>I wrote a tutorial where I show you how to create calligraphy with a regular pen, and if you have a pencil lying around, you can also do calligraphy using just a pencil. </p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_15.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Other articles about calligraphy tools you might be interested in checking out :</p>
                <h4>Step 3 – Find A Proper Study Resource And Create An Effective Practice Routine.</h4>
                <p>Once you’ve picked out the calligraphy style and the needed tools, it’s time to find a proper resource and start practicing.</p>
                <p>One of the best ways to learn calligraphy is by attending an in-person workshop hosted by a professional calligrapher.</p>
                <p>An online workshop is also great. </p>
                <p>However, you can still find a bunch of great free resources online.</p>
                <p>Instructional calligraphy books are also fantastic – I’ll talk more about them later on.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_16.jpg" alt="">
                <p>With the help of a good study resource, you’ll learn how to construct letterforms properly and keep your calligraphy proportional, consistent, and well-balanced.</p>
                <p>Basically, all the elements you need to develop a strong foundation upon which you can then easily build more complex elements and learn new calligraphy styles.</p>
                <p>You could just find an alphabet from Google Images or Pinterest and copy that for several months, but you might do more damage than good with that approach.</p>
                <p>It’s much better to practice with a correctly structured exemplar that has a ductus along with it.</p>
                <p>An exemplar is a full alphabet demonstration for you to use as a reference.</p>
                <p>The ducts are the little red arrows indicating the stroke sequence to construct the letters. You can see an example of it below.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_17.png" alt="">
                <p>Trust me when I say this – finding a good study resource could make a massive difference in the quality of your calligraphy artwork and how quickly you can learn and improve your skills. </p>
                <h4>Creating An Effective Practice Routine.</h4>
                <p>Calligraphy is a motor skill.</p>
                <p>This means that the brain, muscles, and nervous system all need to work together.</p>
                <p>It also means that building muscle memory requires a lot of practice.</p>
                <p>In other words, the more you practice, the better you will become at calligraphy.</p>
                <p>If you’ve been reading my articles or will be reading them, you will often see me repeat the following sentence: Consistent practice is important, but how you practice makes all the difference.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101_18.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Over the years, I’ve seen some people progress more in six months than others in several years.</p>
                <p>The key difference was almost always the way they practiced. </p>
                <p>I cannot stress enough how important it is to create a good and effective calligraphy practice routine and how big of an impact it can have on your progress. </p>
                <p>I also want to point out that it’s important that you make the routine fun.</p>
                <p>Aimlessly copying basic strokes and alphabets can quickly become tedious</p>
                <p>In that article, I share many helpful tips and a suggested practice approach that works for any calligraphy style you choose to practice. </p>
                <p>On top of that, you can check out my article on the most common calligraphy mistakes and how to avoid them. </p>
