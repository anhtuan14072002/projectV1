                <p>If you want to learn how to start with calligraphy, you’ve come to the right place.
                On this page, you will find everything you need to know about what calligraphy is and how to get started with it.
                </p>
                <p>Let’s get started!</p>
                <h4>What is calligraphy? In simple words.</h4>
                <p>Calligraphy is a visual art form that creates decorative handwriting using specific tools.</p>
                <p>In other words, calligraphy is the art of beautiful writing.</p>
                <img src="/images/li_calligraphy101.png" alt="">
                <p>However, calligraphy is a broad term that encompasses a wide variety of styles and cultures from every corner of the globe. 
                </p>
                <p>We can primarily divide calligraphy into different cultures around the world.</p>
                <p>To name a few – </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Western calligraphy (the Latin alphabet)</li>
                    <li>Chinese calligraphy</li>
                    <li>Japanese calligraphy</li>
                    <li>Arabic calligraphy</li>
                    <li>Indian calligraphy</li>
                </ul>

                <p><i><b>Note:</b> Despite the art of beautiful writing being present in many cultures across the globe, I focus primarily on studying, practicing, and teaching Western calligraphy and the Latin alphabet. </i></p>
                <br>
                <h4>What are some key features of calligraphy?</h4>
                <p>It’s important to distinguish between handwriting (including cursive) and calligraphy.</p>
                
                <p>It is common for the untrained eye to see these two as the same.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, here are a few key features of calligraphy. </p>
