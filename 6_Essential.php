                <p>These tools are needed for any calligraphy style you choose to study and practice. </p>
                <p>Of course, with time, you can start expanding your toolbox and try out all sorts of different tools. </p>
                <p>Here I want to show you that you just need a few tools to get started and donâ€™t need to spend a lot of money to get good quality tools. </p>
                <p>I will explain why we use each individual tool, and then Iâ€™ll give you my recommendations. </p>
                <p>I have tried and owned all of these tools, so you know im not just making some random recommendation from Amazon. </p>
                <p>Without any further delays, letâ€™s get started!</p>
                <h3>Here are the 6 essential calligraphy tools â€“</h3>
                <p>1. <b>Calligraphy Pens</b></p>
                <p>2. <b>Paper</b></p>
                <p>3. <b>Ruler</b></p>
                <p>4. <b>Pencil</b></p>
                <p>5. <b>Eraser</b></p>
                <p>6. <b>Inks</b></p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Now, Letâ€™s look closely at each of these individual tools.  </p>
                <p><b>Note -</b> â€“ If youâ€™re just getting started with calligraphy, I highly recommend you check out my <b>ultimate guide for calligraphy beginners.</b></p>

                <h3>1. Calligraphy pens</h3>
                <p>Number one on our list of essential calligraphy tools is â€“ calligraphy pens. </p>
                <p>Itâ€™s crucial to understand that calligraphy is an umbrella term that encompasses various styles. </p>
                <p>And as you can imagine, these calligraphy styles require different pens. </p>
                <p>For this reason, I created a separate, in-depth guide on <b>the best calligraphy pens for beginners. </b></p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>So, if youâ€™re new to calligraphy, hereâ€™s what you should do â€“ </p>
                <p>1. First, pick a style that youâ€™re interested in learning, </p>
                <p>2. Based on that style, choose a calligraphy pen that suits that style. </p>
                <p>Otherwise, you might purchase a pen that isnâ€™t suited for the style youâ€™re interested in learning. </p>
                <p>You will find all the answers to your questions in the calligraphy pens guide I mentioned earlier. </p>

                <h3>2. Calligraphy paper</h3>
                <p>I could talk about paper for hours. </p>
                <p>Thatâ€™s why I wrote a separate guide on the <b>best calligraphy papers.</b></p>
                <p>But since youâ€™re already here, Iâ€™ll give you a brief version of the topic.</p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Not every paper will work with every tool.</p>
                <p>Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s essential to first pick your calligraphy pen and then, based on that, get the proper paper. </p>
                <p>The other important distinction is â€“</p>

                <p>1. <b>practice paper</b></p>
                <p>2. <b>and paper for final artworks</b></p>
                <p>We use nicer and usually more expensive paper for final artwork. </p>
                <p>When it comes to calligraphy practice, we are looking for the best bang for our buck. </p>
                <p>My preferred paper for practice is the Canson Marker paper. </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy4.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It works great with most calligraphy pens. </p>
                <p>Itâ€™s the best paper for brush pens and also handles perfectly the heavier ink flow of the Pilot Parallel Pen.  </p>
                <p>For brush pens, itâ€™s crucial to get smooth paper. </p>
                <p>However, even if a type of paper is smooth to the touch, it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean itâ€™s suitable for your brush pens. </p>
                <p>Your touch might not recognize the little paper fibers, but trust me, your brush pens will. </p>
                <p>Which will inevitably result in frayed tips as well as faster ink consumption. </p>
                <p>That is precisely why the bleed-proof marker paper is my top choice.</p>
                <p>A cheaper alternative would be the HP 32 Premium paper. </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy5.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Unfortunately, thatâ€™s not bleed-proof paper, and with time it will reflect on your brush pens. </p>
                <p>However, itâ€™s still paper of great quality, considering how much it costs. </p>
                <p>Rhodia paper is also excellent for practice. </p>
                <p>It comes in a variety of sizes and patterns on sheets. Lines, grids, dot grids, etc. </p>
                <p>If you plan to practice calligraphy using just a pencil, you can use the cheapest print paper you can find. </p>
                <p>If youâ€™re looking for some nice paper for the final artwork, here is what I recommend â€“ </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Canson watercolor paper</b></li>
                    <li><b>Hahnemuhle watercolor paper</b></li>
                    <li>Khadi handmade cotton paper.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy6.jpg" alt="">

                <h3>3. Ruler</h3>
                <p>The most common use for the ruler will be for creating calligraphy guidelines. </p>
                <p>I created a separate in-depth article about what calligraphy guidelines are and how you can use them to improve your calligraphy. </p>
                <p>If youâ€™re new to calligraphy, I HIGHLY recommend reading that guide, as it will instantly help you improve the consistency of your calligraphy letters. </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy7.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If youâ€™ve been following my content for a while, then you know that the one ruler I constantly recommend is the <b>Rolling ruler.</b> </p>
                <p>The <b>Rolling ruler</b> is like a regular ruler, but it has this cylinder on the back that allows it to roll on the surface.  </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy8.jpg" alt="">
                <p>With the rolling ruler, you can easily and quickly create straight parallel lines. </p>
                <p>Which is just what you need to create calligraphy guidelines. </p>
                <p>You can also work with a <b>regular ruler</b> or even a <b>t-square ruler. </b></p>
                <p>I also like the <b>rolling ruler</b> because it has a built-in mini protractor.</p>
                <p>It is super handy for determining angles for your slant lines. </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy9.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Once again, if youâ€™re new to calligraphy, be sure to check out the calligraphy guidelines article I previously mentioned. </p>
                <p>Aside from guidelines, the ruler is super helpful for creating various layouts and compositions. </p>

                <h3>4. Pencil </h3>
                <p>Ah, the Pencil </p>
                <p>One of my favorite tools ever.</p>
                <p>Cheap, versatile, erasable, yet so underrated. </p>
                <p>I love the pencil, and I use it constantly. </p>
                <p>Did you know that you can use a pencil to create calligraphy?  </p>
                <p>And yes, I have a whole separate <b>tutorial on how to create calligraphy using just a pencil ðŸ˜€</b></p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy10.jpg" alt="">
                <p>However, the pencil is on this list for two main reasons. </p>
                <p>1. Guidelines</p>
                <p>2. Thumbnail sketching</p>
                <p>Usually, we use a pencil to create these guidelines because once we are done creating our calligraphy, we can just erase the guidelines. </p>
                <p>Aside from creating guidelines, the pencil is super helpful for thumbnail sketching. </p>
                <p>Thumbnail sketching is an extremely powerful technique for many art forms, including calligraphy and lettering. </p>
                <p>Whether writing out single words or creating intricate calligraphy layouts and compositions, thumbnail sketching allows you to quickly lay down various ideas. </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy11.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Even if youâ€™re a super experienced calligrapher, you still want to plan out your work, and thatâ€™s when thumbnail sketching is extremely useful. </p>
                <p>For these two purposes, the pencil I use and recommend is an HB pencil. </p>
                <p>Personally, I use a mechanical pencil with an HB lead inside. </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy12.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The reason for that is convenience. </p>
                <p>I always have a sharp tip and never have to sharpen it. </p>
                <p>The HB lead is the one I prefer the most because itâ€™s visible enough and easy to erase once youâ€™re done. </p>
                <p>For calligraphy guidelines, I would avoid using any pencil with a mark B or higher, as those are more difficult to erase. </p>

                <h3>5. Eraser</h3>
                <p>This one is pretty simple. </p>
                <p>You can use any eraser you have or want. </p>
                <p>The one I like to use and that I recommend is the kneaded eraser. </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy13.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Itâ€™s a soft, moldable eraser that doesnâ€™t leave any residue after use. </p>
                <p>The only downside is that it struggles to remove darker pencil marks. </p>
                <p>Thatâ€™s also the reason why I recommend using an HB pencil. </p>

                <h3>6. Inks</h3>
                <p>Calligraphy inks are kind of optional to get started.</p>
                <p>For example, if you get a brush pen or a Parallel Pen, you wonâ€™t need ink to get started.</p>
                <p>If you plan to work with dip pens, you will need ink.</p>
                <p>When it comes to inks, there is such a wide choice. </p>
                <p>For general purposes, when working with dip pens and nibs, I recommend these inks â€“ </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Sumi ink</b></li>
                    <li><b>Winsor & Newton calligraphy ink</b></li>
                    <li><b>Speedball super black calligraphy ink</b></li>
                    <li><b>Higgins black calligraphy ink</b></li>
                    <li><b>Daniel Smith walnut ink</b></li>
                    <li><b>Dr. Ph. Martins bleed proof white ink </b></li>
                    <li><b>Ecoline watercolor inks </b></li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy14.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Sometimes, depending on the nib or the paper youâ€™re working with, you might need to thicken or dilute the ink. </p>
                <p>You can thicken it with gum arabic and dilute it with water. </p>
                <p>There is some trial and error involved before getting the right mixture, but donâ€™t get intimidated as itâ€™s not too complicated of a process. </p>
                <p>And yet, the results are fantastic!</p>
                <p>A great alternative that I also recommend you try out is gouache. </p>
                <img src="images\6EssentialCalligraphy15.jpg" alt="">
                <p>I love gouache because it comes in so many different colors which you can mix and create all sorts of unique shades. </p>
                <p>Also, it comes out very thick, so you just need to dilute it with a bit of water. </p>
                <p>I like the Winsor & Newton gouache, but you can also check this one by Arteza. </p>
                <h4>Wrapping it up, final words. </h4>
                <p>And there you have it, folks.</p>
                <p>These are the 6 essential calligraphy tools you should have to start learning and practicing the art of calligraphy. </p>
                <p>As I mentioned, you can easily expand your toolbox with time. </p>
                <p>There are so many great tools that are unique in their own way.</p>
                <p>A common mistake I see beginners making is spending 30-40$ on premade kits from Amazon. </p>
                <p>On the surface, they might look like fancy calligraphy kits worth the price, but trust me, they are not. </p>
                <p>There are just a few kits out there that I would feel comfortable recommending to beginners.  </p>
                <p>Honestly, once you know why we use these essential tools from the list, youâ€™ll be able to assemble your own kit, which is cheaper and of much higher quality. </p>
