                </p>
                <p>Alright, let’s begin!</p>

                <h3>1. Copperplate calligraphy</h3>

                <img src="images\li-10style.jpg" alt="">
                <h3>Origins of the script </h3>
                <p>The Copperplate script can be traced back to the late 17th century. Back then, known under a different name – the English Round Hand.</p>
                <p>Without going too deep into the whole history of the Copperplate script, the name was adopted later on as calligraphers tried to copy the beautiful letters engraved on copper plates created by the penmanship masters of that time. </p>
                <p>I talk more about this in my <b>article about the history of calligraphy. </b></p>
                <p>However, for a more in-depth explanation of the origins of the Copperplate script, I highly </p>
                <p>recommend checking out this <b>fantastic article</b> by Sybille.</p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-1.png" alt="">
                <h6><b>George Bickham’s</b> Round Hand script, from The Universal Penman, c. 1740–1741 (an engraving, not actual writing). Source - <b>Wikipedia.com {{PD-US}}</b></h6>
                
                <h3>Script characteristics </h3>
                <p>The Copperplate script is undoubtedly one of the most popular calligraphy styles worldwide. Highly slanted, elegant, flowy, delicate, and precise strokes are just some elements that make Copperplate such an attractive style. </p>
                <p>The Copperplate script is mainly created with a pointed nib and ink. </p>
                <p>However, you can also practice it using a brush, pen, or pencil. </p>
                <p>As mentioned, it is a highly slanted style angled at 55 degrees.</p>
                <p>The x-height of letters isn’t fixed, meaning you can determine how big you want your minuscule to be.</p>
                <p>However, when practicing, it’s not practical to have a large x-height (especially when working with a dip pen and ink).</p>
                <p>The ascenders and descenders are one and a half times the x-height, making them proportional regardless of the size you choose to write your letters.</p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-1.png" alt="">
                <p>The best way to begin practicing the Copperplate script is by learning the basic strokes and understanding the proper sizing and proportions of the letters.</p>
                <p>The key is forming strong foundations that will allow you to create letters, words, and even intricate flourishing compositions. </p>

                <h3>Exemplar</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-3.png" alt="">
                <p><b>Note -</b> In calligraphy, exemplars are fully written alphabets that include the ductus. The ductus is the direction that indicates the order of each stroke needed to form the letter.</p>

                <h3>2. Blackletter calligraphy</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-4.png" alt="">
                <h4>Origins of the script</h4>
                <p>Think of Blackletter (gothic) calligraphy as a family of different scripts.</p>
                <p>There are so many different blackletter calligraphy styles that you can practice.</p>
                <p>They all have their own names, history, and little nuances. </p>
                <p>It would be quite impractical to try and cover all of them in a single article, so I decided to go over the most popular ones – </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Textura Quadrata</b></li>
                    <li><b>Fraktur</b></li>
                    <li><b>Rotunda </b></li>
                    <li><b>Batarde</b></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each of these styles emerged in different time periods and locations across Europe.</p>
                <p>However, to generalize, blackletter calligraphy emerged in Northern Europe around the 11th century. </p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-5.png" alt="">
                <h4>Script characteristics </h4>
                <p>Thick, black, dense, vertical strokes with sharp edges characterize black letter calligraphy. </p>
                <p>Blackletter calligraphy is a very expressive calligraphy style (regardless of the specific script), and today, there are so many variations out there that you can practice. </p>
                <p>Blackletter calligraphy is practiced using a broad-edged nib, marker, or fountain pen. </p>
                <p>The minuscules are usually sized at 5 nib widths, while the ascenders, descenders, and capitals are at 7 nib widths.</p>
                <p>However, some blackletter calligraphy scripts use different sizing proportions (i.e., the Batarde script).</p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-6.png" alt="">
                <p>
                Unlike Copperplate calligraphy, where the thickness difference is created by adding/releasing pressure from the pen, the broad-edged nib creates variations in thickness by holding the nib at a consistent angle. 
                </p>

                <img src="images\li-10style-8.png" alt="">
                <p>Unfortunately, I still need tutorials for the Rotunda and Batarde calligraphy scripts, and I couldn’t find any good resources online. However, I did find these two exemplars on Pinterest that you can see below.</p>

                <p>Artist Tri Le created this YouTube video demonstrating a blackletter alphabet –</p>
                <p>If you’re interested in the Textura script, you can check out this tutorial here written by Edgar Villa. </p>
                <p>There is also a beginner’s guide on Fraktur calligraphy written by Jake Rainis.</p>
                <p>Jake’s website is also a great resource for blackletter calligraphy.</p>
                <p>I also highly recommend getting a calligraphy book.</p>
                <p>Calligraphy books are a great alternative for people who are unable to attend any calligraphy workshops.</p>
                <p>In this article, I share my top 10 calligraphy books for beginners.</p>

                <h3>3. Italic calligraphy</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-11.png" alt="">
                <h4>Origins of the script</h4>
                <p>Also known as the Cancelleresca script, Italic calligraphy is a beautiful script that evolved from the Humanist minuscule and originated in Italy during the Renaissance. </p>
                <p>If you’re interested in historical examples of this beautiful script in action, I highly recommend checking out La Operina by Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi.</p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-12.png" alt="">
                <p><b>Note - </b>It is incorrect to call calligraphy styles or scripts – calligraphy fonts. Fonts are what computers and other devices use to display text. Calligraphy styles are either called styles or scripts. </p>
                <h4>Script characteristics </h4>
                <p>Best recognized for its smooth and elegant strokes with a slight forward slant. </p>
                <p>It’s a very rhythmic and dynamic calligraphy style that retains a high level of readability. </p>
                <p>The Italic script is practiced with a broad-edged tool. That can be a broad-edged marker, nib + ink, or a fountain pen (Pilot Parallel Pen). </p>
                <p>Written at a slant between 5 and 10 degrees, the letters are usually taller than wide.</p>
                <p>Minuscules are usually sized at 5 nib widths while ascending and descending letters are extended equal to the x-height but can be shorter or longer if needed.</p>
                <p>The capitals (or majuscules) are slightly lower at 7 nib widths.</p>
                <h4>Exemplar</h4>
                <img src="images\li-10style-13.png" alt="">

                <h4>Resources </h4>
                <p>I wrote a beginner’s guide on how to get started with Italic calligraphy. </p>
                <p>As a beginner’s resource, this YouTube video by Joanne Fink is also very useful – </p>
                <iframe width="875" height="492" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fY1lmErZWb8" title="Calligraphy for Beginners - How to Write a Lower Case Italic Alphabet w/Joanne Fink" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>I also highly recommend the book – Foundations of Calligraphy by Sheila Waters.</p>

                <h3>4. Uncial Calligraphy</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-14.png" alt="">
                <h4>Origins of the script</h4>
                <p>Uncial calligraphy evolved from the Roman capitals around the third century, with even some earlier historical records. </p>
                <p>As Christianity was gaining popularity, the Uncial letters served as the official script for their manuscript, which quickly found its way across Europe. </p>
                <p>Here is an absolutely gorgeous historical sample of the Half-Uncial script from the Book Of Kells (9th century) –</p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-15.png" alt="">
                <h4>Script characteristics </h4>
                <p>As with other traditional scripts, the Uncial comes in many variations.</p>
                <p>The three most notable variations of Uncial calligraphy are – </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Uncial </b></li>
                    <li><b>Half-Uncial</b></li>
                    <li><b>Artificial Uncial</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another distinct feature of the Uncial script was that although it was a pure capital letter script (majuscules), it was the script that first introduced some of the lowercase letters we know and use today. </p>
                <p>The Half-Uncial lowercase letters were even more prominent than the Uncial script. </p>
                <p>It also differed from its predecessor (Roman capitals) by an absence of serifs. </p>
                <p>The Uncial style is usually created using a broad-edge calligraphy tool (nib, marker, fountain pen, brush).</p>
                <p>It is commonly sized with 4 nib widths and an extra nib width for the slight extensions of specific letters.</p>
                <p>Fun Fact: Calligrapher Daniel Reeve used the Uncial script to develop one of the fonts used in the Lord Of The Rings movies. </p>
                <p>\A subsequent form of the Uncial is the Artificial Uncial, a more elaborate form characterized by serifs resembling the Roman Capitals. </p>
                <p>You could say it’s a more elegant-looking Uncial that requires a higher level of skill with the pen. </p>
                <p>If Uncial calligraphy is something you would like to learn, I suggest starting with the classic form of Uncial before attempting the Artificial Uncial. </p>

                <h3>5. Roman Capitals</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-17.png" alt="">
                <h4>Origins of the script</h4>
                <p>Roman Capitals date all the way back to the first century. </p>
                <p>They originated in Rome hence the name, and it is with this script that the journey of the Latin alphabet began. </p>
                <p>I find it absolutely fascinating the fact that these letterforms were developed by people nearly 2000 years ago and that they remained virtually unchanged until today. </p>
                <p>That such beauty, precision, and attention to detail existed back then. </p>
                <h4>Script characteristics </h4>
                <p>With Roman Capitals, we can make two clear distinctions – </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Roman Square Capitals </b></li>
                    <li><b>Rustic Capitals</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Roman Square Capitals is a geometrically based script where the widest letters (such as the O) fit in a perfect square, which gives it its distinctive name. </p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-18.png" alt="">
                <p>However, not all letters share the same proportions. </p>
                <p>Some of them fit in only half of the square shape, and the proportions of each letter are exactly predetermined. </p>
                <p>These letterforms are strong, wide, and precise, and I think they perfectly represent the Roman Empire. </p>
                <p>You will need a broad-edged tool to start practicing the Roman Square Capitals. </p>
                <p>It could be a nib, marker, or fountain pen. </p>
                <p>A flat brush is also an excellent tool for this script, considering the complex manipulations required to create the serifs. </p>
                <p>However, the best way to begin learning the Roman Square Capitals is by properly understanding the correct proportions of the letters using a pencil. </p>
                <p>Practicing the monoline skeleton of this calligraphy style will immensely improve your understanding and thus allow you to improve once you start using a broad-edged tool.</p>
                <h4>Rustic capitals</h4>
                <p>Although the Roman Square Capitals were a great representation of the might of the Roman Empire, it was a rather impractical script when it came to execution. </p>
                <p>Creating such beautiful letterforms takes time and effort, not to mention the ample space it takes. </p>
                <p>The Rustic Capitals was a script that solved this issue and had a more colloquial use. </p>
                <p>The Rustic Capitals are characterized by a narrower form achieved by a more narrow pen angle and a more relaxed hand movement. </p>

                <h3>6. Foundational Hand</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-20.png" alt="">
                <h4>Origins of the script</h4>
                <p>The Foundational Hand was created in the 20th century by the famous calligrapher Edward Johnston. </p>
                <p>The Foundational Hand is a script based on the historical Carolingian minuscule from the 10th century. </p>
                <p>According to Johnston, the Foundational Hand is the best script for beginners to start practicing calligraphy. </p>
                <h4>Script characteristics</h4>
                <p>The Foundational Hand is a clean upright calligraphy script written with a broad-edge pen. </p>
                <p>A key focus letter of this style is the letter o since nearly all letters fit into that rounded shape. </p>
                <p>Like the Roman Square Capitals, the letter o of the Foundational Hand also fits proportionally into a square. </p>
                <p>The pen angle is mainly kept at 30 degrees, except for diagonal letters, where it’s turned to 45 degrees to balance the weight of the stroke. </p>
                <p>Such a pen angle gives us a very well-balanced look of thick and thin strokes across the letterforms.</p>
                <p>The Foundational calligraphy is sized with 4 nib widths and 2 additional nib widths for ascenders and descenders.</p>

                <h3>7. Spencerian Calligraphy </h3>
                <p>The Spencerian script is a calligraphy style dating from the 19th century in the United States. </p>
                <p>Developed by Platt Rogers Spencer, hence the name, Spencerian was so popular and widespread across the country that it became the official writing style in both personal correspondence as well as at a government level. </p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-22.png" alt="">
                <h4>Script characteristics </h4>
                <p>Unlike Copperplate, Spencerian is written at a slightly softer angle. </p>
                <p>Instead of a 55-degree, it’s a 52-degree slant. </p>
                <p>It’s also less shaded than Copperplate, giving it a more delicate look. </p>
                <p>The shade means the thicker downstroke. </p>
                <p>Another notable difference between the two scripts is that Copperplate is more oval-based, whereas Spencerian has a bit more of an angular look between the downstrokes and upstrokes. </p>

                <h3>8. Gothicized Italic</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-24.png" alt="">
                <h4>Origins of the script</h4>
                <p>This is probably one of my favorites from this list. </p>
                <p>It combines two of my very dear calligraphy styles – blackletter (gothic) and italic. </p>
                <p>Gothicized Italic as a script was developed by famous calligrapher Edward Johnston. </p>
                <h4>Script characteristics </h4>
                <p>This style is so particular because it retains the strength and rigidity of blackletter calligraphy. Still, simultaneously, the curves taken from the italic script add more rhythm, which also improves the legibility. </p>
                <p>It’s like mixing PB & J. It’s a fantastic combination that everyone loves!</p>
                <p>Gothicized Italic is created with a broad-edged pen. Again, that could be a nib, marker, or the popular Parallel pen. </p>
                <p>The proportions of Gothicized Italic are the same as for blackletter calligraphy.</p>
                <p>An upright slant, an x-height of 5 nib-widths, and 2 extra nib widths for the ascending and descending letters.  </p>
                <h4>Exemplar</h4>
                <img src="images\li-10style-25.png" alt="">
                <h4>Resources</h4>
                <p>This is a fantastic one-hour lecture on Gothicized Italic calligraphy by Eleanor Winters – </p>

                <p>Additionally, I also recommend this book – Foundations Of Calligraphy by Sheila Waters. </p>

                <h3>9. Neuland Calligraphy</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-27.png" alt="">
                <h4>Origins of the script</h4>
                <p>The Neuland script was created in the 20th century by German type designer and calligraphy Rudolf Koch.</p>
                <p>Neuland was initially created as a typeface and, in later years, adopted by calligraphers as a writing alphabet.</p>
                <p>Along with Edward Johnston, Rudolf Koch was also considered to be at the forefront of the revival of calligraphy as an art form during the 20th century. </p>
                <h4>Script characteristics</h4>
                <p>What makes this calligraphy style so unique is its simplicity and boldness. In other words, it’s funky and chunky. </p>
                <p>It’s a complete majuscule script (only capitals), and it has a distinctive playfulness. </p>
                <p>You will also notice that there is a lack of contrast between the thick and thin parts, as you can see with other broad-edged scripts. </p>
                <h4>Exemplar</h4>
                <img src="images\li-10style-28.png" alt="">
                <h4>Resources</h4>
                <p>A good starting point is this YouTube video by Maria Montes – </p>
                <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9a24RQN5aA" title="Introduction to Neuland Calligraphy" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>She covers the very basics of the Neuland script, such as sizing, proportions, basic strokes, etc. </p>
                <p>Additionally, I recommend the following books – </p>
                <p>Calligraphy Bible by David Harris</p>
                <p>Speedball Textbook 25th Edition </p>

                <h3>10. Modern Calligraphy</h3>
                <img src="images\li-10style-29.png" alt="">
                <p>I left modern calligraphy as the last item on this list since it’s something that stands out from this list. </p>
                <p>Modern calligraphy is more of a concept than a particular script. </p>
                <p>Thus, including the script’s origins, characteristics, etc., doesn’t really apply here. </p>
                <p>Today the word modern calligraphy triggers a specific image to calligraphers. </p>
                <p>Bouncy and swirly letters were created with a brush pen.</p>
                <p>I see and think about modern calligraphy as a much broader term. </p>
                <img src="images\li-10style-30.png" alt="">
                <p>In short, modern calligraphy is any type of calligraphy that doesn’t strictly adhere to the rules of traditional scripts. </p>
                <p>This is a more suitable definition since modern calligraphy isn’t just bouncy brush calligraphy. It’s much more than that. </p>
                <p>Modern calligraphy can be created with virtually any writing tool you can think of. </p>
                <p>So, for example, you can create a modern alternation of a blackletter script or perhaps of italic letter</p>
                <p>You can create modern alternations from the Copperplate script, Spencerian, and Roman capitals and minuscules. </p>
                <p>What do you think about how we came to have so many different styles to practice today 🙂 ?</p>

                <h4>Final words about calligraphy styles</h4>
                <p>So to recap the whole story. </p>
                <p>If you’re just starting, pick one style, get the needed supplies for that style, and start practicing the calligraphy style you chose. </p>
                <p>With time you can start learning more styles and gradually build up your skill level. </p>
                <p>Now let me ask you a question – </p>
                <p>What calligraphy style are you practicing, or would you like to start practicing?</p>
